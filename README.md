# fruit store

Assignment for Interview: 2022-311 Full-Stack Software Developer in Forschungszentrum JÃ¼lich.

## Description for example code

Your client needs a web application to keep track of fruits they have in stock. The client wants to be
able to:

- add and subtract a number of a some fruit (e.g. add 5 apples, subtract 7 oranges)
- show the inventory of the storage at a certain date + time (fruit names and current counts)
- Ensure that the total number of fruit in the system at any given time cannot exceed 1000 (storage capacity is limited) or a fruit count become negative (this does not make sense).
